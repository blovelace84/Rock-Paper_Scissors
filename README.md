I did my first python project for the first after learning python. I made a Rock Paper Scissors game as a way to show how much I know about python. The game consists of a user player and a computer player. To play the game, the user would need to run this program on their IDE. The programs starts with a enter your choice input. From there, the user picks between Rock, Paper or Scissors. Once the user types in their answer, the results show whether they when the round or not. If the user wants to leave the game, they type exit to leave the game. The final score is display after the player leaves the game.
